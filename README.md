# MAMMT

Multipurpose Auotmata Mamma Mia Repacker, made purely for memes.    
Why not python? Python is for pussies!(Joking don't cancel me on twitter please)

".cpk" pack/unpack. FIle can be compressed but i don't recommend to do so. 

".dat/.dtt" can be packed with new files. Hashes are calculated and alighned.
In the unpacked folder you will find the "mamma.mia" file. It is needed in order to pack a new file 100% identical to the original. The program will work without it, but as I understand it is better to have it for some sensitive files.

Usage:    
Drag files to unpack    
Drag folders to repack. Tool will expect folder names like something_dat, something_dtt or something_cpk 

.NET6 dependent.
