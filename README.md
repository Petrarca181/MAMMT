# MAMMT

Yet Another Mamma Mia Repacker, made purely for meme purposes.    
Why not python? Python is for pussies!(Joking don't cancel me on twitter please)

Tool can rebuild dats with new files. Hashes are calculated and alighned. <<== needs deeper testing.     
In the unpacked folder you will find the "mamma.mia" file. It is needed in order to pack a new file 100% identical to the original. The program will work without it, but as I understand it is better to have it for some sensitive files.

Usage:    
Drag dat files to unpack    
Drag folders to repack.    Tool will expect folder names like something_dat or something_dtt    

.NET6 dependent.
